## About Me

I studied applied math and engineering at Hawaii Pacific University in Honolulu before recently transferring to the University of Washington engineering program as a junior. I am very interested in accessibility research and I want to work towards decreasing barriers that keep individual’s from achieving their goals. 

## About My Mentor

Richard E. Ladner, Professor Emeritus, in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering has been on faculty at the University of Washington since 1971. He obtained his undergraduate degree at St Mary’s College of California in 1965 and went on to receive his Ph.D in mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley in 1971. He has received numerous awards for his research and has been working in accessible computing for over 30 years. He is the principal investigator for AccessComputing Alliance and led the Summer Academy for Advancing Deaf and Hard of Hearing in Computing between 2007 and 2013. Some of his awards include the Harrold and Notkin Research and Graduate Mentoring Award (2019), the Strache Leadership Award from the Center on Disabilities at California State University, Northridge (2018) and the SIGACCESS Award for Outstanding Contributions to Computing and Accessibility (2016). He continues to make significant contributions to accessibility research. 

## About My Project

My project will be working on an animated character system for American Sign Language based on si5i [1]. I will be designing and building an app for designing these characters and how they work, including incorporation of location, facial expression, hand shape, orientation. Unlike si5s, motion will be indicated by animation rather than symbols [2].
