I was able to make a static sign using CSS and HTML code. I had to make some small transformations and I am not sure this is the most efficient way to accomplish what I wanted. I have had difficulty on the movement version of the sign such as pause, move up, then mirror flipped. I was able to figure out how to get a horizontal line of signs or vertical lines of signs. I have also started coding a story using static characters.
