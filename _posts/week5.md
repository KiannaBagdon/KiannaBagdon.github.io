I learned how to make animations in microsoft power points as an example of how we could set up the animated signs. I tried it out to see if we wanted to use a similar user interface for this current project. It is a very detailed system. Now, I am working on creating a pull down menu and having the static symbol come up when you select an item from the pull down menu. The user will be able to select the symbol and adjust the size, the location, and animation which will then provide a code that will be usable. I have been coding HTML and Java to complete the end product.
