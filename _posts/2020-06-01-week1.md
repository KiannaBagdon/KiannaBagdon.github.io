For my summer research project, I will begin designing characters for an animated character system for American Sign Language. The design needs to include how these characters work, including incorporation of location, facial expression, gender, right vs left side, etc. This first week I have been reading background information on an animated character system for ASL and on other written ASL notation systems. Bragg, Kushalnagar, and Ladner’s study, “Designing an Animated Character System for American Sign Language” supports that there is value for an animated character system, provides a structured approach for the design, and provides ASL users input for the design. ASL-Flash and ASL-Search show the different features of sign, handshape, location, and so on. This information will help guide the categorization of the features of signs in the animated character system. I will need to learn si5s which is one writing system for ASL and Javascript to potentially implement an entry system to create animated signs.
